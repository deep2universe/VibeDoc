Include short reactions ('Wow!', 'Okay, that's wild...') and light humor. Make concrete feature mentions with personal 'aha' moments.

You're not wrong—I've basically become a Bolt evangelist since the hackathon last month. *laughs* So Bolt.new is this completely browser-based development environment that's, well... it's changing how I think about coding.

No servers, no complex setup—everything runs locally using this technology called WebContainers. I literally asked it to 'Build a Pomodoro timer with a cool animation' and had a finished, working app in under two minutes. It felt like...
