Balance technical accuracy with approachability. Include genuine 'lightbulb moments' ('Wait, so I can literally just decorate a function and it becomes an AI tool?!'), practical examples, and authentic reactions. Show the journey from simple 'Hello World' to powerful implementations. Present the SDK as 'Python superpowers for AI integration'.",
