Right now, most language models are basically trapped in their own little universe – they can chat with you brilliantly but can't really touch your other applications or services. The Model Context Protocol changes that completely. It's like... imagine if your smartphone couldn't install any apps and suddenly someone invented the app store. That's the scale of change we're talking about. MCP creates a standardized way for AI models to safely interact with external tools, resources, and services through a client-server architecture. I've been implementing it in a few projects, and it's genuinely exciting to see these models suddenly being able to check your calendar, search your documents, or even control your smart home – all while maintaining proper security boundaries.",

Then there are clients, which maintain individual connections. And finally, servers that provide specialized information or capabilities. So when you ask your AI coding assistant to explain a function in your codebase and suggest improvements, the host knows it needs to access your files, so it creates a client connection to a file server, gets the code, and then maybe connects to a documentation server for best practices.

So if a user only has access to certain models, or has a preference set up in their client, that takes precedence.
